# Project Idea

1. Users can log in to the application with a username and password.
2. The application uses JWT tokens as the authentication method for communication.
3. users with admin rights can create more users.
4. The main function of the application is to discover and tag Spielplatz in Germany.
5. Users can enter their zip code, PLZ, or city name to get information about neighboring Spielplatzes.
6. Each Spielplatz has its own address, opening hours, a brief description, several pictures and labels. For example, whether there are slides, rope toys, see-saws, sandy areas, whether soccer is allowed or not.
7. users can save their favorite Spielplatz and rate and comment on Spielplatz.
8. The list of Spielplatz can be sorted by rating, distance from their current location.
